# sample_vfi
This folder includes a sample code to solve an unemployed worker's problem, illustrated in the problem set distributed in 501b, FL2022. 
 
The additional code that ends with "JIT" uses the NUMBA library to speed up the code. This code is adapted from the Quantecon resource (https://python.quantecon.org/mccall_model.html), which is an excellent source to learn to code economic models in Python, starting from how to install the program and necessary packages.
